Privacy Policy

This extension collects the URL of the active browser tab in order to extract the GitHub username when the browser action icon is clicked.

Active tab URL collection is limited to what is necessary for the core functionality of opening the GitHub Profile Viewer for the user of the current tab. The URL is only used to extract the username and construct the Profile Viewer URL.

The active tab URL is not stored or shared with any third parties. It is only temporarily accessed when the browser action is triggered and immediately discarded after the Profile Viewer URL is constructed.

No other user data, browsing history, or personal information is collected, stored or transmitted by this extension.

Users can disable active tab URL collection by disabling or uninstalling this extension.

If you have any additional questions, please contact us at sametcn99@gmail.com

This policy provides transparency into how the extension handles user data to build user trust.
